# IB-Personal-Project_2015-16
I did the IB Personal Project in my high school freshman and sophomore years. It is required in order to pass the IB Middle Years Programme and transition to the IB Diploma Programme as a junior. For my project, I decided to learn some MATLAB programming, as it would be a very useful programming language to use in the STEM field.

I created a set of MATLAB mini-scripts that solve a variety of simple mathematical and computational problems. Note that not all of the scripts work as expected and may be buggy, as I was new to MATLAB at the time and had no prior experience.

See the IB Personal Project Report for details regarding my process of planning and creating these scripts, and also my reflection and development as an IB learner.
